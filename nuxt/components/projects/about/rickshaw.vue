    <h3>Rickshaw</h3>
    <p>
      Rickshaw is an open-source project designed to provide contact details for
      tourists traveling in rickshaws. The project was initially created as a
      request from a family member, blending utility with creative design.
      Available in the GitHub repository
      <UiExternalLink href="http://github.com/sabeerbikba/rickshaw"
        >sabeerbikba/rickshaw</UiExternalLink
      >, this project aims to deliver a simple yet effective solution tailored
      to a tourist audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      With features like a gallery for uploading and viewing images and a
      creatively designed home page resembling the back of a rickshaw, the
      project showcases both functionality and visual flair. It&apos;s
      accessible, user-friendly, and built to demonstrate creativity while
      meeting practical needs.

    <h4><strong>Motivation and Goals</strong></h4>
    <p>
      The primary motivation behind the project was a request from a family
      member to create a website for tourists. This prompted me to take a simple
      idea and add creative touches to make it visually engaging while
      maintaining its utility.
